**Installation Options**
---

1. Install with [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/stronghold/)
    + `$ pip install stronghold`
    + `$ stronghold`

2. Download the `stronghold` binary from Releases tab.


**Configuration Options**
---

1. Firewall

    + Turn on Firewall?
        - This helps protect your Mac from being attacked over the internet.
    + Turn on logging?
        - If there IS an infection, logs are useful for determining the source.
    + Turn on stealth mode?
        - Your Mac will not respond to ICMP ping requests or connection attempts from closed TCP and UDP networks.

2. General System Protection

    + Enable Gatekeeper?
    	- Defend against malware by enforcing code signing and verifying downloaded applications before allowing them to run.
    + Prevent automatic software whitelisting?
        - Both built-in and downloaded software will require user approval for whitelisting.
    + Disable Captive Portal Assistant and force login through browser on untrusted networks?
        - Captive Portal Assistant could be triggered and direct you to a malicious site WITHOUT any user interaction.

3. User Metadata Storage

    + Clear language modeling metadata?
        - This includes user spelling, typing and suggestion data.
    + Disable language modeling data collection?
    + Clear QuickLook metadata?
    + Clear Downloads metadata?
    + Disable metadata collection from Downloads?
    + Clear SiriAnalytics database?

4. User Safety

    + Lock Mac as soon as screen saver starts?
    + Display all file extensions?
    	- This prevents malware from disguising itself as another file type.
    + Disable saving documents to the cloud by default?
        - This prevents sensitive documents from being unintentionally stored on the cloud.
    + Show hidden files in Finder?
    	- This lets you see all files on the system without having to use the terminal.
    + Disable printer sharing?
        - Offers redundancy in case the Firewall was not configured.

**How to Contribute**
---

1. Clone repo and create a new branch: `$ git checkout https://github.com/alichtman/stronghold -b name_for_new_branch`.
2. Make changes and test
3. Submit Pull Request with comprehensive description of changes

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
